# qnotes

qnotes is a terminal app that allows you to quickly take notes right into your terminal.

You can call qnotes by simply typing qnotes new into your terminal followed by your note (qnotes new Feed Mark).

You can view your notes but typing "qnotes show" into your terminal. This will display a list of your notes and the date they were created.

You can also delete notes by typing "qnotes delete" followed by the number cooresponding to the note you'd like to remove.
